- 👋 Hi, I’m @richland100
- 👀 I’m interested in defi
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all things crypto
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how to go from non-tech background to deciphering all this super advanced computer language 
- 📫 How to reach me @richland100 twitter
- My biggest complaint against this entire industry is that all these folks in this sphere just asume everyone understands what they know, but do they know how to do your job, i would be willing to bet they don't, so have a little patience and help them crossover into your world
